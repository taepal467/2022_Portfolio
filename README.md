## My process
I used the Freecodecamp Sass tutorial template to create my portfolio. Instead of using the same design, I changed a few things:
  - Instead of using an image for the header like in the orginal portfolio, I decided to use an animated background using SCSS. 
  - Instead of having different html files for each section, I kept all sections on one html file by creating an #id in each of the a tags for each section.
  - I changed the footer so that it will stay at the bottom of the web page instead of staying fixed in the header.
  - Changed the social icons from being vertically stacked.
  - Changed the structure of the about me section.
  - Added a resume button to link up with my resume file. 
  - Changed the design for the projects section.
  - Added a custom favicon
